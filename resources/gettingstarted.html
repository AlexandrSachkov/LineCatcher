<p class="header" id="overview">Overview</p>

<p>Line Catcher (LC) is an advanced programmable log parsing tool aimed to simplify
    and save time on viewing, searching, and parsing large text files.</p>
    
<p><table>

        <th>Issues with large files</th>
        <th>How we solve them</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Large files are hard to open since they do not fit into memory</td>
        <td>LC keeps only the required part of the file in memory while still allowing 
            fast navigation using indexes. Indexes are generated the first time file is opened.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Searches are time-consuming. For example, searches on a file of 50GB can take over 30 mins; 
            tweaking search parameters would mean re-running this lengthy process many times.</td>
        <td>LC is optimized for fast file processing. While there are limits to how fast a file 
            can be read since we are bound by disk read speeds, we can search smarter by limiting 
            the amount of lines to process. LC offers a number of tools to limit search area including 
            reusing previous search results. As an example, you can first run a general search to note 
            points of interest (generate an index), then run a more detailed search that narrows down 
            results from the previous search. As a result, the next search can be significantly faster 
            than the first.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>There are too many results. Searching a large file can produce thousands of results,
            most of them may be irrelevant.</td>
        <td>LC allows defining very specific search criteria to retrieve only relevant results. 
            Multi-line search enables using information from adjacent lines to include more context 
            in the search.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Extracting information is challenging and often requires custom parsing scripts/applications.</td>
        <td>LC contains an embedded Lua scripting engine allowing you to write a custom parser and output

<p class="sub_header" id="openAndView">How-to: Open and view large files</p>

<p>On launching LC, you will see the <b>main application screen</b> where you can access key menu options:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the <b>File</b> menu, you can <u>open data files</u>, 
        <u>open index files</u>, <u>close all tabs</u>, and <u>exit the application</u>.</li>
    <li>In the <b>Run</b> menu, you can open <u>search</u> and <u>advanced search</u> windows, 
        as well as launch a <u>Script Editor</u>.</li>
    <li>In the <b>Configure</b> menu, you can access settings to <u>change viewer font size</u> and 
        select an option to <u>cleanup files on closure</u>.</li>
    <li>In the <b>Help</b> menu, you can open this <u>getting started guide</u>, 
        <u>Lua API docs</u>, and <u>About</u> window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/main_screen.png" alt="Main application screen"></p>

<p>
<u>Open a file</u> to view by clicking <b>“File” >> “Open” >> “Data”</b>. A browsing window will pop up 
    where you can navigate to the desired file directory. Once you’ve clicked <b>“Open”</b>, the file contents 
    will be displayed in the <b>file viewer</b> area.
</p>

<p>
    The first time you open a file, LC will generate indexes to enable random access. <b>Line navigator</b>
    lets you see the total number of lines, as well as swiftly jump to a specific line by typing
    its number in the line navigator window. Indexes can be set to be automatically deleted after closing 
    application by enabling <u>"Cleanup files on closure"</u> setting.
</p>
<p><img src="images/file_viewer.png" alt="File viewer"></p>


<p class="sub_header" id="regularSearch">How-to: Search and open search results</p>
<p>To <u>search a file</u>, click <b>“Run” >> “Search”</b> to open a search window.</p>
<p><img src="images/regular_search.png" alt="Regular search"></p>

<ol>
    <li><span><b>Source</b>: Use the Browse button to navigate to the source file you want to perform search 
        operations on.</span></li>
    <li><span><b>Save results to</b>: You can save your search result to re-use it for other searches. 
        You need to select a <u>directory</u> to store your results to find them later. 
		"lc_results" is a default results file name, which you can update.</span></li>
    <li><span><b>Limiters</b>: Limiters are used to narrow down the search area.</span>
        <ul>
            <li><span><u>Start line #</u> is the first line LC will refer to when starting the search. 
                By default the value is set to 0, which means LC will start searching from the 
                first line.</span></li>
            <li><span><u>End line #</u> is the last line LC will consider when ending the search. By default 
                is set to 0, which means - end the search with the last line of the document.</span></li>
            <li><span><u>Max result #</u> is the max number of results to retrieve. By default is set to 0, 
                which means - find all occurrences.</span></li>
            <li><span><u>Index</u>: This feature allows reusing previous search results to generate a more specific
                result set without having to search the entire file again. If index file is specified, 
                then the search will only look at lines specified in the index. You can use indexes with
                other limiters to get an even more specific search result.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span><b>Search</b></span>:
        <ul>
            <li><span><u>Pattern line</u> contains the pattern to use during search. By default, every 
                line will be checked for containing the pattern text.</span></li>
            <li><span><u>Regex</u> option if checked - the pattern is treated like a regular expression.</span></li>
            <li><span>Select <u>Highlight results</u> box - search results will be highlighted in the file.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    After the search is complete, a <b>search viewer</b> window will open at the bottom of the <b>file 
    viewer</b> area. You can drag this window up or down to reduce or increase its size. If your case requires
    more specific search parameters than UI permits, refer to <b>How-to: Scripting</b> section<u></u>
</p>
<p><img src="images/result_viewer.png" alt="Result viewer"></p>

<p>
    Search results (index file .lcidx) are persisted to file due to their potential size as well as to allow reuse 
    in subsequent runs. You can <u>open the results output file</u> by clicking <b>“File” >> “Open” >> “Index”</b>. 
    The results file contains full path to the associate data file. Consequently, opening the index file will 
    result in the data file opening as well, unless it is already open. If data file is not found at the provided path, 
    Line Catcher will also look in the index's local directory for it. Search result files can be set to be
    automatically deleted after closing application by enabling <u>"Cleanup files on closure"</u> setting. 
</p>


<p class="sub_header" id="highlighting">How-to: Highlight text</p>
<p>Highlighting functionality becomes available once you have opened a data file. 
   There are three ways to highlight text in the file:</p>
<ol>   
    <li><span>Via drop-down menu: select text with your mouse anywhere in the document, right click 
		and select <b>"Highlight"</b> option in the drop-down menu; </span></li>
	<li><span>Via <b>Highlights view</b>:</span>
		<ul>
			<li><span>Type in the pattern you want to highlight and click “Add”. The pattern will appear
			as one of the items in the list;</span></li>
			<li><span>If <u>Regex</u> option is checked, the pattern will be treated like a regular expression. 
			Type in the regular expression and click “Add” result to the list.</span></li>
		</ul>	
	</li>
	<li><span>Via <b>Search view</b>: while searching for a pattern, check <u>Highlight results</u> to 
              highlight search results.</span></li>
</ol>   
   
<p><img src="images/highlighting_view.png" alt="Highlighting view"></p>

<p>Each time you highlight text, it will receive a random color. You can change the assigned color by going to
   <b>Highlights view</b> and clicking on the pattern color that you want to change.<br>
   Clicking “X” button next to a highlighted pattern will remove the selection, while “Clear All” will remove all highlighted patterns. 
   When you close the data file, all highlighting will be removed automatically.
</p> 


<p class="sub_header" id="multiLineSearch">How-to: Multi-line search</p>
<p>
    Multi-line search allows specifying search parameters for adjacent lines to increase result relevancy.
    It works by sliding a frame of 21 lines wide down the length of the file allowing to specify search criteria
    for the current line (equivalent to standard search), previous 10 lines, and subsequent 10 lines.
    You can think about it as a standard search which searches one line at a time but also allowing you to look
    back 10 lines and ahead 10 lines.
</p>
<p><img src="images/frame.png" alt="Frame"></p>

<p>To run <u>multi-line search</u>, click <b>“Run” >> “Search (Advanced)</b>” to open a search window. 
    Most parameters in this dialog will be identical to the regular search, except for the <u>Search</u> section.
    The Search section allows specifying search criteria for multiple lines within a 21 line frame (read above) up
    to a maximum of 5 lines (Scripting allows using all 21 lines. See <b>How-to: Scripting</b> section).  
    Each row contains parameters for a single line. <u>Line #</u> is the number of the line to search relative
    to the center of the frame (Line #0) and can be any number between -10 and 10 inclusive. Checkbox in front
    of each row enables using parameters specified in that row. The rest of parameters are identical
    to the standard search. During search, if the given frame matches all search parameters, 
    the center of the frame will be added to search results.
</p>

<p><img src="images/advanced_search.png" alt="Multi-line search"></p>

<p>
    As an example, lets have a look at the above image. This image depicts configuration for a milti-line search
    that specifies search parameters for 3 lines:
    <ul>
        <li><span> Line #-1 must contain text "test 1"</span></li>
        <li><span> Line #0 (frame center) must also contain text "test 1"</span></li>
        <li><span> Line #2 must contain text "7"</span></li>
        <li><span> Other line parameters are deactivated (unchecked)</span></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Line Catcher automatically handles edge cases where a frame hangs off the end of file. If an index is specified 
    in the <u>Limiters</u> section, the search will only touch parts of the file specified by the index with
    frame center being positioned on each index location. For example, if the index contains line #1000, 
    the above search parameters will check if line #999 contains "test 1", line #1000 contains "test 1", 
    and line #1002 contains "7". If there is a match, then line #1000 (center frame) will be added to search results.
</p>

<p>
    When using multi-line search, consider search performance. Performance for this search is considerably lower
    than the standard one due to the increased number of comparisons. Therefore, it is recommended to use
    it with an index as a method for narrowing down results (if the file is large).
</p>


<p class="sub_header" id="scripting">How-to: Scripting</p>
<p>
    Scripting is a powerful feature that allows leveraging Line Catcher's systems to perform custom searches,
    write parsing algorithms, and extract data. Scripts are written in Lua.
</p>

<p>
    To access scripting view, go to <b>“Run” >> “Script”</b>. A Script Editor window will pop up. 
    We provided some <b>example scripts</b> for you in <b>“&lt;installation directory&gt;/Line Catcher/scripts”</b>. 
</p>

<p>
    To run a script, click <b>“Run”</b> button. The <b>console output</b> window will notify you if 
    the script compiled or failed to compile. If you have made any changes to the script, 
    the <b>“Save”</b> button will turn red as a reminder to save the changes. 
	If the file is read-only or located in the read-only directory, <b>"Save"</b> button will be disabled. You can instead use <b>"Save As"</b> button to save file in the directory of your choice.

<p>
    <u>Change font size</u> of your file by dragging the pointer left or right.<br/>
    <u>Cleanup files on closure</u> by checking the box. It will delete generated index and search results 
    files automatically on closure. This is disabled by default.
